                <p>Hello! I'm Marc Rodriguez. I'm originally from Augusta, GA. The past decade of my life has been quite a journey for me. I got to travel to Seoul, South Kore and Taipei, Taiwan to teach English as a second language. I embarked on 2 multi-month road trips with my wife through New Zealand and the USA. After all this traveling, we have decided to settle down in Seattle because the Pacific Northwest is stunning. I am now ready to embark on my next adventure: <strong>Learning Software Development.</strong></p>
                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>Music has always been an important part of my life. It calms me. I find that no matter what I'm going through, the right music will help it feel alright. I generally have some music playing if I am at home. I like music of all kinds. Check out my Spotify account to the right to check out what I have been listening to lately.</p>
                <p>I try to go to as many gigs as I can afford to see. The past year has been hard for gigs. There were so many good gigs coming to Seattle in 2020. :(</p>
                <p>Not only do I enjoy listening to music, but I have been playing the drums since I was 10 years old. I have a weekly jam session with some old friends on Friday nights. It's a nice way to unwind at the end of the work week.</p>
                <p>I also enjoy hiking and camping. The Pacific Northwest is a great place to walk about. I also enjoy reading comic books, playing table top games, cooking and traveling.</p>
